Go, a popular programming language, is celebrated for its simplicity, speed, and reliability, making it perfect for crafting command-line tools.

Building a CLI tool involves handling command line inputs, outputs, and other system resources. As your app grows, managing this complexity can get tricky.

Enter [Cobra](https://cobra.dev/), a fantastic Go library. It simplifies building scalable, maintainable, and extensible command-line interfaces.

In this tutorial, I'll guide you through using Cobra to create a Go CLI tool. We'll focus on building an Ip Tracker tool to effortlessly track IP addresses. Let's explore Cobra's key features and benefits along the way!

### Prerequisites

<callout-info>
- Basic understanding of Go programming.
- If you're new to Go, check out the [official Go tutorial](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1).
- Ensure you have Go version 1.19 or above installed. You can download it [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Install Cobra Generator:

To streamline the integration of Cobra into your application, we recommend using the Cobra CLI. Install it effortlessly with the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/spf13/cobra-cli@latest
```

Once installed, access the CLI by typing `cobra-cli` in the terminal.

### Create a New Project:

Start by setting up the project directory. Execute the following commands to create a new folder for your application and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir ip_tracker && cd ip_tracker
```

Now, initiate a Go module for your project:

```bash
go mod init iptracker
```

With the module in place, create the application using the Cobra CLI

```bash
cobra-cli init
```


### Adding Commands:

In the world of CLIs, commands are like the heartbeatsâ€”they do things. They're the main players in your application, each representing a specific action.

Every Cobra app has a root command. When you say the CLI's name, this command wakes up. Normally, it shares info about the app, but you can make it do something special. You'll find this root command in `cmd/root.go`. Open it up and make it look like this:

```go
package cmd

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/spf13/cobra"
	"os"
)

var rootCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "iptracker",
	Short: "Track IP addresses",
	Long:  `A Go based CLI tool to track IP addresses`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		fmt.Println("Welcome to iptracker_cli!")
	},
}

func Execute() {
	if err := rootCmd.Execute(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}
```
